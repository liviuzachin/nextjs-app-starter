# NextJS App Starter template

This is a starter template for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn), the React framework.
Next.js gives you some of the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

## Installation

Install dependencies using the following npm command:

```bash
$ npm install
```
## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` where the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
